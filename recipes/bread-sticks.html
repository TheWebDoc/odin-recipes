                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
                        <li>1 cup warm water, or more as needed</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
                        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1 cup sourdough starter</li>
                        <li>1 egg, separated</li>
                        <li>cooking spray</li>
                    </ul>
                <h3>Steps:</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mix 2 tablespoons sugar with water until dissolved. Add yeast and let sit until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, mix remaining sugar, flour, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Combine sourdough starter and egg yolk in a separate bowl. Whisk egg white lightly and reserve in the refrigerator.</li>
                        <li>Pour yeast and sourdough mixtures over the flour mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough starts to form and all dry ingredients are incorporated. Turn out onto a work surface and knead into a smooth ball.</li>
                        <li>Spray the inside of the bowl with cooking spray. Place dough in the bowl and cover with a cloth. Let rise for 1 hour</li>
                        <li>Punch down dough and divide into 12 portions. Roll out into small balls; shape into 3- to 4-inch-long sticks. Divide bread sticks between 2 greased or nonstick pans. Cover with cloths and let rest for 45 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until light brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove 1 pan at a time and brush tops with egg white. Continue baking until medium brown, 5 to 10 minutes more.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Cook's Notes:</h3>
                    <p>Add any toppings you like after brushing bread sticks with egg white.</p>
                    <p>You can use a stand mixer to mix the dough and knead it with the dough hook if preferred.</p>
                    <p>Let cool fully and place in a zip-top bag to freeze. Will last 6 to 8 months in the freezer with no change in the taste or consistency. To thaw: just place them in the oven at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 10 to 15 minutes. Need them fast? Pop them in the microwave for 1 minute at power level 8 and put them in the oven for 4 minutes at 400 degrees F (200 degree C).</p>
